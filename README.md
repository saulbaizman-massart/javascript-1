# javascript 1 demo

These demos are related to chapters 1&ndash;3 in Jon Duckett's "JavaScript and jQuery."

Though the repository contains only two files, the demos are in the commit history. The history contains detailed annotations of the changes I made to the files, and you can view the demo at every step of the way and download a copy of the demo at any point in time.
